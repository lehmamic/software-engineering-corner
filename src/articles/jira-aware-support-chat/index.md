title: 'Cybernetic AI for Smarter JIRA Support'
description: >-
  In DevOps, resolving JIRA tickets efficiently is critical, yet teams often waste time on issues that first-level support could have solved or on recurring problems that are hard to find due to JIRA’s exact-match search. To address this, I built a cybernetic AI tool. By indexing all JIRA support tickets in a vector database and combining it with an AI-driven chat interface, the tool retrieves similar past cases, suggests solutions, and streamlines the entire support workflow.
